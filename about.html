                    <strong>AI is the next huge development in the tech world. You can actually make a machine mimic the human brain which has the power to think, analyze and make decisions.
                        Furthermore, libraries such as Keras and TensorFlow bring machine learning functionality into the mix. It gives the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Also, we have libraries such as openCv that helps computer vision or image recognition.
                        Python is the leading language of many data scientist. For years, academic scholars and private researchers were using the MATLAB language for scientific research but it all started to change with the release of Python numerical engines such as ‘Numpy’ and ‘Pandas’.


Python also deals with the tabular, matrix as well as statistical data and it even visualizes it with popular libraries such as ‘Matplotlib’ and ‘Seaborn‘.

                    <strong>Java is one of the most popular languages in the world. It is used by some 9 million developers and it runs on around 7 billion devices worldwide according to Oracle blogs. Because of the high demand for Java, Java developers are also quite sought after and they hold some of the most high-paying jobs in the industry. The average salary of a Java Developer lies between $47,169 to $106,610 per year.
                        Java is very versatile as it is used for programming applications on the web, mobile, desktop, etc. using different platforms. Also, Java has many features such as dynamic coding, multiple security features, platform-independent characteristics, network-centric designing, etc. that make it quite versatile.
                        Java is platform-independent as the Java source code is converted to byte code by the compiler which can then be executed on any platform using the Java Virtual Machine. Java is also known as a WORA (write once, run anywhere) language because it is platform-independent.

Also, the development of most Java applications occurs in a Windows environment while they are run on a UNIX platform because of the platform-independent nature of Java.

                    <strong>Kotlin has always been and continues to be a modern language in the industry, addressing the real needs of real developers. It is increasingly being adopted in many trending fields, including mobile, web, server-side and cloud development, data science, and education.

                        This all gives a strong indication that there is already significant demand for Kotlin developers and there will continue to be in the future.
                        
                        So where can you start learning this skill? “Atomic Kotlin”!
                        
                        This book is suited for Kotlin learners of all levels, and it is available in print and as an ebook. It breaks Kotlin programming language concepts into atoms, and provides hands-on exercises inside IntelliJ IDEA.
                        
                        To celebrate the recent release of “Atomic Kotlin”, we asked our Twitter community to share their motivation for learning Kotlin. You all did not disappoint! There were a lot of great responses from the community, and we saw a couple of patterns emerging. In this post, we are going to share with you some of the answers people gave about why Kotlin is a great language to learn.

                    <strong>Sure, there are plenty of websites that provide free or inexpensive templates, but that not only limits what you can create, it also leaves you with a website that looks like everyone else’s. The most successful websites are ones that stand out, ones that are engaging and memorable in the way they portray your brand.  You want to dazzle your users so they make a purchase from you, refer your services to a friend, or become loyal customers. When your page blends in with the crowd, you risk being forgotten.

                        Having the knowledge to build your own website with HTML and CSS gives you the chance to stand out from the crowd with an authentic, hand-crafted representation of your business, or any business for that matter. Save money on every site you may want to build in the future, and build better websites with HTML and CSS.
